# PEER-TO-PEER skill transfer
The peer-to-peer training is aimed at increasing bioiformatics knowledge sharing between experts and novices.The program will include bioinformatics training on various topics.
We will conduct a pilot of the programming in the month of June and July with two meet-ups each week.
## Learning outcomes
## Curriculum
The pilot programme will include trainings on the following topics:
* Introduction to Bioinformatics
* Genomics 
* NGS Technologies
* Bioinformatics Database
* Unix Shell
* Git and Github
* R programming
* RNA Seq analysis demo(Galaxy & Terminal)
